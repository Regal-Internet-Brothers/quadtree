# quadtree
A basic quad-tree module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey). This module is experimental, and may change drastically at a later date.

This module supports both Mojo and Mojo 2 for debugging purposes. To enable Mojo 2 support, define 'QUADTREE_MOJO2'.
